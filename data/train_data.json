        "Hello doctor, I get a cough for the last few days, which is heavy during night times. No raise in temperature but feeling tired with no travel history. No contact with any Covid-19 persons. It has been four to five days and has drunk a lot of Benadryl and took Paracetamol too. Doctors have shut the OP so do not know what to do? Please help.",
        "Hello, I understand your concern. I just have a few more questions.Does your cough has phlegm? Any other symptoms like difficulty breathing? Any other medical condition such as asthma, hypertension? Are you a smoker? Alcoholic beverage drinker?",
        "Thank you doctor, I have phlegm but not a lot. A tiny amount comes out most of the time. I have no difficulty in breathing. No medical conditions and not a smoker nor a drinker.",
        "Hi, I would recommend you take n-acetylcysteine 200 mg powder dissolved in water three times a day. You may also nebulize using PNSS (saline nebulizer) three times a day. This will help the phlegm to come out. I would also recommend you take vitamin C 500 mg and zinc to boost your immune system. If symptoms persist, worsen or new onset of symptoms has been noted, further consult is advised."

        "Hello doctor, I am suffering from coughing, throat infection from last week. At that time fever did not persist and also did not felt any chest pain. Two days later, I consulted with a doctor. He prescribed Cavidur 625, Montek LC, Ambrolite syrup and Betaline gargle solution. Since then throat infection improved and frequent cough also coming out. Coughing also improved remarkably though not completely. From yesterday onwards fever is occuring (maximum 100-degree Celcius). I have not come in touch with any foreign returned person nor went outside. In our state, there is no incidence of Covid-19. Please suggest what to do?",
        "Hello, I can understand your concern.In my opinion, you should get done a chest x-ray and CBC (complete blood count). If both these are normal then no need to worry much. I hope this helps.",
        "Thank you doctor, After doing all these I can upload all for further query.",
        "Hi, yes, upload in this query only. I will see and revert to you.",

        "Hi, I can understand your concern. I have gone through the report you have attached. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).Your total count is on the higher side of normal along with low hemoglobin. So start Azithromycin 500 mg 1-0-0, Tablet Dolo 650 1-0-1. Once your fever and cough subside, start an Iron tablet for low hemoglobin.I hope this helps.",
        "Thank you doctor, How many tablets of Azithromycin to be taken? Is it in the morning? I want to make you know that I have already taken Azithromycin five days before. Should she start it? And also can I start an Iron tablet today itself?",
        "Hi, Yes, you can take iron tablet from today onwards. And no need for Azithromycin now as you have already taken it. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. Do warm water gargles and steam inhalation four to five times a day."

        "Hello doctor,I am a 23-year-old man. I have anxiety and depression but no immunodeficiency disorders or chronic diseases. First, I wanna know if my immune system is weakened and how likely am I to die of Coronavirus.Second, I have itchiness in my throat and shortness of breath. I always have it because of anxiety but now it is more persistent than before. I also feel a very subtle feeling of pain, burning sensation and itchiness in my chest. I did not go out during the past ten days and have not been in contact with someone with positive Covid. And I quit smoking past week. Down to one or zero cigarettes from 20 a day. Why am I feeling itchiness and pain and burning sensation? How likely am I to have Covid-19? And how likely am I to die from it?",
        "Hello. Anxiety can manifest itself in physical or psychological symptoms or both. The irritation sensation you are experiencing is a part of your anxiety. Also please do not believe the hype about covid. It has a low mortality rate, of 2-3 percent, that too mortality is very high in people above 60-70 years with other co-morbidities. You do not have any such disorders and you have not even been in contact with anyone, so do not worry.Please continue to take your medicines for anxiety if you are taking them, if not, please consider visiting a psychiatrist and get started on some low dose SSRI type of medicines. Also, if needed a low dose Benzodiazepines can be added temporarily. Also, please do some deep breathing exercises, or progressive muscle relaxation. You can also take some honey with water to reduce the itching in the throat and also try doing some gargles with lukewarm salt water."

        "Hello doctor,Last night I was getting chills, feeling more cold than usual and lightheaded and a lot of burping. Maybe like every 30 minutes or less or so feel more chills running down my body and chest feeling bit weird like I am starting having trouble breathing then goes back to normal and repeats, with weird feeling like chills down my left and right lungs or left and right upper chest. Also, my heart was pumping fast. Also, some minor coughs were there since seven days ago, still here. I have white mucus and have not gotten yellow yet.I took medicines yesterday but today I got severe cold and flu medicine with a pain reliever, the chills did not go away. Then today, I called the doctor on the phone and told him what happen last night and the same thing happened this morning too. I had minor coughs, feeling lightheaded, feel like maybe cannot breathe or something, and a lot of burping. I told him the burping issue was going on for at least two years, but somehow this time I am feeling lightheaded. He just gives Pepcid, a try maybe GERD. I ate that today still feeling chills now and still burping a lot.Right now, still some chills on arms, with breathing issue or something makes my chest feel weird and arm sometimes. So, should I be worried? I do not think I have a fever now but do not feel hot on the forehead? Was it GERD or flu, it is Coronavirus or something else? I hope it is not Coronavirus.I am 21 years old and weigh around 110-115 kg.",
        "Hello,please answer the following:Any travel history in the last one month? Any use of airports? Any fever, have you checked the temperature? Any cough? Any mucus or phlegm? How is your sleep? Is there any malaise or body aches or weakness?",
        "Thank you doctor, I travel to school, nearby grocery stores in the bus. No airport exposure. I have not checked the temperature. I do not feel hot or anything. I have minor coughs and sore throat. Yes, I have mucus which seems white or clear for now.During sleep, I do not have much aches. Last night I have not got much sleep, probably because I was thinking about stuff being worried, but got some sleep though.",
        "Hi, most probably with the history it does not appear like a severe problem or Coronavirus infection. Is sore throat severe and does the pain last the whole day? Do you smoke or drink?Can you try taking Sudafed, Tylenol, and Zyrtec and try getting sleep for a few days? I am sure that will make you feel better.Avoid exposure to smoke dust and cold winds. Keep the AC to a minimum or use ceiling fan instead. Drink plenty of water and warm fluids. Avoid eating out, partying. Avoid unnecessary travel.You need not quarantine yourself in the strictest manner but some amount of restrictions in interacting and meeting with the community is advised.Lastly, where are you currently? Your place of residence and country? Is it a Corona endemic country? Did you talk to or interact with any known or suspected flu patient?Can you please take a picture of the back of the throat with open mouth showing details of the tonsils and pharyngeal wall and send it to me?",
        "Thank you doctor, I woke up this morning, I had trouble sleeping being worried, but I got some sleep then nearby phone ringing woke me up.So far, seems no one got any severe coughs or pain so far. I only hear minor coughs the past week or so. Thanks for those medicine recommendations for sleep. I fall asleep quicker, usually, it takes me around one hour to fall asleep on most days.I will try to avoid smoking as much as possible. Yes, I will be staying inside since many places are on lockdown. And school is online. I recently turned on the air purifier to clean up some air for allergies possible viruses but makes me cold. I might not need AC unless really hot.I will be staying home for the next month at least. My chills right now are feeling a bit better, but a little sick only because maybe I did not get enough sleep.I stay in San Francisco CA, United States, and there are close to 40 confirmed cases around here. No severe reports near my district, and have not heard anyone in serious condition.So, last week I have a sore throat and tonsil pain while swallowing for a few days, then one day drank a lot of honey and water and some tea, then it got better. Not sure if it got smaller, but the pain was less now though. Between my tonsils in the middle (behind the tongue) looks like my throat, got some red stuff, maybe looks like inflamed or rashes. Any recommendations? Any foods or drinks that can help?",
        "Hi, you have got it right. Follow all the precautions. You will be alright soon. Try getting a good sleep tonight.I heard about the cases in SF. My brother was supposed to fly there from India for work but his meeting got canceled in the wake of the virus.Yes, your camera has not done a decent job this time around. It has not focussed on our area of interest. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). But yours has picked up the two big bumps in the back of the throat (enlarged tonsils).The tonsils could be enlarged due to the current infection and sore throat problem you are having. Once the problem is resolved they should get back to their normal size, which I guess, in you, must be slightly big. The pharyngeal wall between the tonsils could be having some granular bumps which are quite common during an infection.Now you do not worry, for most such infections are due to viruses (not Corona). They usually get better with time and supportive treatment. Traditional Indian forms of medicine advise honey and hot water. Tea makes a good addition I guess. Sudafed and Zyrtec appropriate for your weight will help additionally. Tylenol every time you got pain will help you tide over this period wonderfully.Now watch for some warning symptoms fever, increased pain, thick mucus, thick postnasal drip, severe malaise, swelling in the neck, etc. In such cases promptly revert to me. You may need a Z pack then.",
        "Thank you doctor, As of now 12:40 PM I am breathing harder than usual since 30 minutes ago. I only ate some breakfast and drank water.Here is my story: Before Feb 28th - no issues at all, besides always burping a lot, sometimes bloating, no coughs, tonsil was enlarged for a while, no lightheadedness, no breathing problems, not sick.Friday February 28th - I woke up feeling unwell, drank water went back to bed, came back out super lightheaded about to faint, lied on bed for an hour, came out stomach feeling weird, even more lightheaded about to faint, can barely even eat a little noodles and two small pieces of spam, vomited it, then four more times which as water or acid. Hours later was better.Saturday February 29th - diarrheaSunday March 1st - diarrheaMonday March 2 - diarrheaTuesday March 3 - diarrheaWednesday March 4 - No stoolThursday March 3 - No more diarrheaFriday March 4th - Monday March 9th - no issuesMonday March 9th - feeling better, no problems, enlarged tonsil, no coughs really.Sunday march 15 - no problems besides burping, minor coughs, some sore throatAfternoon I ate chicken, burping a lot, stomach uncomfortable, felt like breathing problems, chills on hands, chest and left and right side, felt like could not breathe. 20 minutes later, still chills breathing a bit better, lightheaded kind of feel like fainting, then went to bed for 15 minutes (the breathing problem and weird chest feeling comes back randomly), ate tums, then later I drank cough and flu medicine.On Monday march 16 - woke up around 11:30 AM, feeling breathing problems, chills around body, lightheaded again, chest feeling weird, burping a lot, and I described my story to doctor he said it sounds like you ate something bad, does sound like GERD, of course we do not know for sure unless lab tests maybe on stool. He asked have you tried stronger antacids like Pepcid or Zantac?I said no. Then doctor asked me to try Pepcid and tell me how it goes.Tuesday and Wednesday March 16/17 - feeling better, no lightheadedness, no more chills, minor coughs, sore throat, burping a lot, no breathing problems so far. Pepcid no problems so far besides making me burp almost all day.Wednesday night still coughing a lot and drank severe cold and flu medicine.Thursday march 21 I woke up fine, then once ate Pepcid and drank some water, heart rate was going really fast, started to make worried, called doctor office they said can you count your beats per minute, then I counted, my phone was showing my heart rating going to 120 bpm, when I counted to them was not 120 bpm, then they told me to call back if it gets worse. Then shortly after, I drank some water and ate a little bit of breakfast. My heart rate started to drop slowly and was getting better after that.Friday march 20- 10 AM I woke up with some chest pains (chest area above the stomach), then some coughing and feeling a little sick, little lightheaded, heart beating fast, breathing harder, felt of shortness of breath. Drank some water and breathe harder, a little bit of mucus.15-20 minutes later no more chest pains, still breathing harder.11 AM - still breathing a little bit harder than usual, coughing would make me breathe even harder. Better now, but still breathing a little harder than usual.11:30 AM moving makes me breathe harder, sat in bed.11:58 AM - feeling a bit better12:10 - feeling like breathing a harder than usual.After an hour later, feeling better now which is strange. Not sure if its heart problems, acid reflux, chest issues, or esophagus.",
        "Hello, always Protonix is better than Zantac. Try using Protonix (Pantoprazole). Do not lie down immediately after consuming meals. Do not drink a lot of water after a meal. Avoid spicy and oily foods.",
        "Thank you doctor, I went to the store to look for Zantac they did not have it, so I talked to the pharmacy they said sounds like could be some weird chest tightening and the doctor said since Pepcid and Zantac are the same. He said to try Ranitidine.Right now I tried Pepcid again like now, for the first five to ten minutes I think it means me feel more nervous or anxiety or something, I tried to calm myself by putting fingers on teeth. Then I think now it did not cause my heart to beat super fast this time which was strange. Even water makes my heart beat a little faster. Should I stick with Pepcid? Finish the entire bottle? I think it has 20-30 pieces.I used to lie down after a meal a few years ago like I get hungry before I go to bed then I started eating snacks and lying down. Sometimes I starve myself. Sometimes I wake up with acid feeling in my mouth.I don't know why I woke up this morning with chest pain, like the middle area right above the stomach and felt like I had breathing problems, breathing harder than usual, drank water and barely could eat breakfast (lasted for at least 30 minutes+). I then waited a bit after 10 minutes, drank hot water and ate breakfast, I started to breathe better again.Could it be shortness or breath? May be blood pressure? Esophagus issue? Chest issue? Heart issue? I am having weird breathing. Should I be worried?",
        "Hi, you need to take Pantoprazole or any other proton pump inhibitor. Avoid heavy meals. The issue appears like a heartburn problem due to acidity only. It does not appear sinister.",
        "Thank you doctor, I was trying to finish the bowl of food in one hour. I was eating veggies and rice, halfway through felt something like acid may be some pain in chest and throat. Feeling lightheaded so ate some meat to then coughed after.",
        "Hi, do not worry about it. Drink plenty of water but not immediately after a meal. Eat well cooked meats.",
        "Thank you doctor,I really appreciate your help so much. I appreciate your time and effort to help me and give advice. Only thing I am worried is just the chest pains, breathing issues and esophagus and throat stuff. I will try to wait two to three hours after eating or drinking before bed now. I hope to get less chest issues when I wake up.",
        "Hi, do not worry so much. You will be absolutely alright. Give it some time. If you are not getting better we can do laryngoscopy and check if there is anything wrong with the larynx. Do you eat healthy food and do exercises?",
        "Yeah if it doesn't get better Laryngoscopy would be perfect. Okay, I'll give it some time Thank you!I try to eat vegetables and fruits. I don't eat much junk food that much. I used to eat more junk years ago, but now mostly vegetables, fruits, meat (pork, chicken, beef, fish) usually not fried, and tried to eat whole wheat bread with fried chicken patty from the super market (for school lunch) since its cheap and its chicken (stopped now after acid problems), don't really eat french fries, pizza or drink soda etc...Exercise, haven't been exercising these few months. I have been telling myself that, but then i haven't really been doing it. Used to a lot years ago, now barely.Since high school, when i exercise running when i try to get air feels like throat is tight or chest is tight and air is trying to squeeze its way through. After this point High school until college feels like i'm not breathing enough air. When i was younger (Elementary/middle school) felt like i gotten a lot more air then now through my throat and air doesn't squeezes through.One doctor just used stethoscope for heart and lungs, told me to breathe hasn't said much about it. Then another doctor said, sounds you are not breathing that much, feels like not getting another air (in high school, like 4-6 years ago maybe), they didn't do much about it.So, when i try to breath regularly, seems like not much air comes out through mouth even before acid reflux,.That's why recent breathing problems kinda worry me, but anyways yeah like that.",
        "I guess you are in the right track. With regards to food diet and exercise.Restart doing your exercise. Keep yourself active. Try having more than three meals a day but keep the quantity of each meal less than the usual. That way you eat more frequently but without putting weight or adding unnecessary calories."

        "Last tuesday I had a flu shot and a neumonia shot. I am 68 and male. I had a very sore arm and felt bad the next day in which I had blood drawn for a test. The results showed a high white cell blood count as well as high ANC and AMC. Could these high readings be because of the shots the day before?",
        "Hello, * The pneumonia shot per se is not responsible for high WBC count, but as you are telling there are soreness and bad feeling at the injection site over arm, there are all possibilities that you have cellulitis or possible abscess formation at the injection site; which will recruit neutrophils at the site and cause secondary rise in WBC count. * Primary relief with ice application and secondary management with systemic antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines with your doc.

        "I have been on methadone for approx. 5 years now at a dose of 30mg taken 4 times daily. This has not only stopped any unpleasant withdrawl symptoms but has also offered considerable relief in easing chronic pain from a severe back injury 11 years ago. For the first 3 years of taking the medication I found that while it was effective in these areas their was an exceptional side effect in that it absolutely obliterated any interest in sex or even the ability to physically have sex. Also I found that I had next to no energy, making many things I used to enjoy fall by the wayside which in turn led to severe depression. After extensive talks with my Doctor I was sent for blood analysis and it was found that my level of testosterone was so low it barely registered.

But if the chest X-ray is improving, then possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely. So apply warm water pad on the affected areas. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid sudden jerky movements of the chest. Take simple painkillers and muscle relaxant drugs like Ibuprofen and Thiocolchicoside. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

        "Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Imodium is having loperamide. It is not a good drug for diarrhea. So you should not take it. You should definitely take probiotics as they are the first line treatment for diarrhea. Along with probiotics, eat more curd and yogurt. Avoid oily and spicy food. Avoid junk food.

Once your pneumonia is cured, your pain will definitely subside. Mucinex is a good drug for pneumonia. It actually dilutes the secretions and made them easy to cough out. So continue with Mucinex.

Is it dangerous for my mother, who seems to be recovering or has recovered from her pneumonia, to be placed in the same room as a patient with advanced pneumonia?",
        "Hello,To be honest, there is a chance of cross infection from one person to another. However, this depends on so many factors and most of the infections, especially bacterial pneumonia, do not transmit easily. If more than one arm distance, the chance is very little and if not too close (like kissing etc.) the chance is further reduced. If two of them are already on antibiotics, as in your case, there is a chance but in the setting what u described, it is extremely unlikely. Hope I have answered your query.

        "My husband (age 63 and in great health) was diagnosed with strep pneumonia and spent 3 days in the hospital, he was released with antibiotic Levaquin, after 5 days I had to bring him back to the ER because he spiked a fever of 101. They discovered that the original pneumonia of the right upper lung was almost gone but it had spread to the lower lobe. They discharged him with prescriptions for Azrithomycin 500 mg once a day for 7 days and Amox TR-K CLV 875-125 twice a day for 10 days. The Amox is making him very nauseated and he gets headaches from it. Can he stop taking it after 7 days instead of 10? Generally he is feeling better, no fever since beginning the two antibiotic combination?",
        "It will be better if he takes it for 10 days. In order to prevent from nausea and headache you cam give him combination of antacid with antiemetic i.e drugs like PANTOP D OR NUPENTA DSR OR GEMPRAZ DSR ONCE A DAY for the rest of the treatment period."

        "I have been ill for 6 weeks and my GP suspected pneumonia and I was put on antibiotics.  The third one has almost cleared the infection.  However, I had an X-ray and it apparently showed nothing at all, although all my symptoms were in line with pneumonia and my GP had definitely heard a lot of crackles in the left lung.  Is it possible that I had pneumonia if the Xray was clear?",
        "Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. For diagnosis of pneumonia, chest x ray need to have infiltration.With normal chest x ray, pneumonia is not possible. Cough, congestion, crackles on auscultation are also seen with bronchitis. And bronchitis shows normal chest x ray too.So it is quite possible that you improve within antibiotic because antibiotics also work in bronchitis. So I don't think you are having pneumonia because your chest x ray is normal. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."

        "Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. If you are not having fever, cough or chest pain after completing antibiotics, you are probably cured from pneumonia. You are should also get done chest x ray.

        "NAME: Brent.AGE: 22SEX: MaleSYMPTOMS :I have a cough that seems to be reccursive. It occurs usually at nightime, or if I gave a very intense sneeze or laugh. When this cough occurs, it is very dry, that it would sound like a yelping dog. Also, besides cough, I do experience a reccursive runny nose, sometimes coupled with watery red eyes and itchy throat. The runny nose discharge is transparent, almost like saliva or tears. Ironically, after a while, these symptoms would disappear, and when they do disappear, I feel completely normal.  I have already consulted a doctor and was diagnosed of allergic rhinits. She adviced me to take anti histamines, either zirtec or iterax, which ever do i prefer. Unfortunately, it works at often but not at all times.HOW MANY DAYS?:Reccursive cough has been going on since april of this year. As for the runny nose, since november of last year ALLERGIES: not that i know of, When I was five years old, I remember being diagnosed of Primary Complex, but was able to be treated before it goes into something else. Also, TB runs in the family, as my uncle had it before, and so as my mom (although the doctor said it was already a scar). As for me, 2009 was a stressful year. There were months, when my hours of daily sleep was only around 3 to four hours due to school work. Also, for a period of time I was involved in smoking, although it has been a month since I stopped. Doctor, I would just like to know what are the chances of me, acquiring respiratory illness like pneumonia or tuberculosis, or development of asthma? Also, if i get to consult a doctor personally with my parents, will the doctor be able to detect my past smoking habit, based on the procedures he will do, or with tests that he will recommend like xray? The truth is, I am hesitant to go to a medical clinic, because my parents have to accompany me, and I am afraid that the doctor might make \"bisto\"  towards my parents, as they don't know that I do smoke. But i do really want to seek medical attention. Besides the incovenicence of symtpoms, I am worried that it might be something serious. Hoping for a  share of your brilliant expertise. thank you doctor and good day.",
        "Thanks for your concern. The dry cough basically has a few causes....First is Post nasal drip, second  Gastroesophageal reflux'heart burn', third Cough variant aasthma, forth Heart failure and finally Interstitial lung disease. Based on the information if you don't have a heart burn or reflux of food or sour brash into your mouth, you are having a cough variant asthma, make sure you do not have difficulty breathing. There is something called cardiac asthma, but it's not much of a likelihood given your young age.I advice you that you give up on smoking as it causes a multitude of problems and may well be related to the cough you've been having now called as 'smokers cough'.It's time that you stop smoking, avoid animal dancers, mites, pollens and any thing that would exacerbate the illness, make sure you don't have a heart burn, and if still the cough persists , meet a pulmo neologism and get a Pulmonary function test with methacholine challenge."

Then the next night it starts again. Has been home since Feb. 2. Current medical doctor provided meds to sleep but that was worse. My mother is the primary caretaker and has reported his night sleep is off after returning home. Does the new diagnosis cause this or is there is a reason. Thanks.",

        "Hello Gigi !Coughing up blood with sputum (henoptysis) is a red flag sign .. meaning to say it definitely needs Medical attention . Considering you have had TB in the past there are many possibilities for your present episodes of hemoptysis.  It could me a bacterial infection or relapse of TB or post TB bronchiectasis (abnormal permanent dilation of your airways at few places which happens when they get damaged due to your past TB). Take a course of antibiotic as prescribed by your physician ,Consult with your physician  and discuss about taking drugs like tranexemic acid which reduce the bleeding tendency , cough suppressants . while sleeping, Lie on the side which was previously affected by TB and be on complete bed rest . Once your hemoptysis gets controlled go for sputum examination to check for TB bacilli , chest x ray and if needed HRCT thorax (to pick up bronchiectasis which can sometimes be not evident on x ray). Since u mentioned severe back pain , vascular abnormalities concerning  the descending aorta (the major blood vessel carrying blood from the heart)needs to be also considered  Treatment is to be decided based on the cause for your hemoptysis.Do review with your physician and get the necessary investigations done."

I just completed 5 days of treatment with pills after 4 or more days of IV in the hospital following gall bladder surgery. I entered the hospital with pneumonia (not knowing I had it), probably having contracted it from my brother who had it and whom I had visited several days earlier in another hospital. I am 71 years old, female; I had a non-heart damaging heart attack in 2003 and have tried to maintain a good exercise program to lessen my chances of worsening heart disease. Should I resume Naproxen for joint/muscle pain; had 2 doses (2 tablets twice daily) 2 days before hospitalization. Did not need it the 3rd day and was hospitalized the next day. Did not take it post hospitalization. Do not remember if they gave it in hospital; think not. Thank you.",
        "Hello welcome to HCM. I have gone through your history. You have been adequately treated for your pneumonia and I suppose you don't have any symptoms of pneumonia like cough, fast breathing, fever, breathlessness. Since you have received intravenous plus 5 days of oral antibiotics, now you can resume about your exercise regime. As you say you had a non damaging heart attack, means that your heart pumping function is well preserved. So you must not have any issues with exercise. With every lung infection the lung capacity decreases by some percentage proportional to he severity of the infection. Hence along with your routine exercises you must also undergo breathing exercises with incentive spirometry, inhaling deeply through one nose holding your breath and exhaling fully from the other nose, meditation and yoga. This will help you to regain some of the lost lung capacity. You should also get vaccinated with influenza and pneumonia vaccines that include common strains which cause pneumonia Remember they don't protect you against all pneumonias but offer protection against common pneumonias.Regarding Naproxen too much of it may cause damage to your kidneys so I advice you decrease its usage and use it only when required rather than a daily basis.Wishing you good health. Regards."

        "I have had a Percocet addiction for 35 years and have had many Dr.s in that time span. I was up to without exaggeration, eating 240 10mg p s, 98 30mg oxycodone pills, as well as an assortment of 5mg pills which were always at my disposal. I have cancer and have severe back injuries but along with the p s I also had monthly access to 240 2mg xannax pills which after awhile Ihad no problem eating all of the above each month and would look for some more. I died 4 times in a 6 year span due to double pneumonia which the Dr.s told me my medications were playing a large roll in this. When I was 16 I became an atheist due to my brother dying, he was my favorite and I became very drug dependent to kill the pain. This lead to my later addictions and no matter what I tried I could not escape their grip.The last time I was in the hospital I said Lord I do not know if you are real but if you are I am begging you to open my heart again to you and I need your help or this will probably be it for me when I leave the hospital, I have had enough, and this is only the drug portion of my life I would not wish the things and amount of death I have had to witness on anyone. I am the last of all my friends left alive and I am 53years old. Over 40 friends have passed on, 2 of which I grew up with from the age of 5, others just would not listen. I lost 2 older brothers, 1 my 1st year in highschool the other 8 years later of an overdose. Needless to say ptsd, depression and other problems haunted me until I did as many drugs as possible to bury the pain, but demons only stay buried so long which I found out the hard way. tiny2882@comcat,net.",

        "My fiancé has been coughing uncontrollably every night for the past 4 months. He is 23 years old, 5'9\", about 140 lbs., and has been told by his dr that he has walking pneumonia. He has been prescribed antibiotics, cough syrup, allergy medicine, mucinex, nasal sprays, and inhalers and although they suppress the coughing at times he still does not seem to have gotten rid of the coughing. His coughing is accompanied with phlegm and has also caused him to throw up due to the extremity. He does smoke cigars as well. What is this!?",
        "Walking pneumonia is a non-medical term to describe a mild case of pneumonia. It is usually called atypical pneumonia because the disease is different from more serious cases of pneumonia caused by typical bacteria. it is often the result of a lung infection from a bacterial microorganism called Mycoplasma pneumoniae and generally treated with antibiotics. Mild infections are often not treated because they tend to clear on their own. With treatment, most people begin to feel better within a few days."

But the doctor in Mexico where I was originally treated said I had PB pneumonia. I was on intravenous antibiotics for three days in Mexico before coming home to my dr.here in L.A.The xrays showed lots of mucus in my lungs.  I am confused.  is there a definitive test for petusses in adults? Dr said I will be fine. Gave me ADVAIR and cough medicine and says I will be fine but will cough for a pretty long while until the lungs are clear.  He said I do not need antibiotics because I have already had zpack and 10 days of ampicillin, and then 3 days fo intravenous antibiotics. Who do I believe?

Diagnosis of Pertussis is clinical usually,divided into 3 stages .1st stage (catarrhal) where runny nose, sneezing, low grade fever, occasional cough. 2nd stage (paroxysmal) bursts of coughing or numerous rapid coughs, difficult to expel thick mucus from airways in lungs , long respiratory effort with high-pitch breath sound , individual may have cyanosis with or without vomiting during severe attack, inbetween attacks, patient becomes normal.3rd stage is convalescent or recovery gradually from above all. overall period may range from 1-2 weeks to 10-12 weeks.  In which cases diagnosis is not certain or require confirmation *Culture of bacterium Bordetella pertusis from nasal secretions *PCR test identifying genetic material from the bacterium in nasal secretions.

Is this from the steroid injection? I am 23 years old and I have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis so I am also taking humira, methotrexate, plaquenil, and folic acid for the RA. Is this a side effect or a drug reaction or nothing to be concerned about?",
        "Tingling in extremities may be a sign of peripheral neuropathy, wich is most of the cases caused by inflammatory injury to the nerves. Anti-TNF drugs, such as Humira, have been reported to be associated to this kind of injury, that can be potentialized when associated to steroids.

        "Lung whiteout and loss of heart outline are findings of chest x-ray compatible with many abnormal conditions affecting the lungs, like pneumonia, pleural effusion, acute respiratory distress syndrome among others. In the actual setting, your father is already receiving treatment to his pneumonia. All the other possibilities are probably been considerated and adressed by CCU staff. Weaning from mechanical ventilation is sometimes challenging because many factors can impair patients evolution, like how long he's been in MV, his nutrition status, his cardiovascular performance and resolution of the cause that led him to MV in the first place."
