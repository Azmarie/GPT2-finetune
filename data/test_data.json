        "If you've been infected by SARS-CoV-2, develop Covid-19 symptoms and recover, can you: 1) develop immunity to Covid-19 2) infect others after 14 days post-symptom onset & recovery 3) get re-infected later by SARS-CoV-2 despite developing immunity?",
        "Yes, Maybe, Maybe. We presume one is immune to a respiratory virus for a while after getting the infection (that's the way it is with other viruses). A few people have trouble with their antibodies and don't have much immunity. Shedding of viruses sometimes is longer than 14 days. In life, there will always be some people who get reinfected, for whatever reason. Usually one is immune after the infection. (3/21/20)."

        "If I get coronavirus, are there ways to avoid getting other illnesses as well, like pneumonia?",
        "Coronavirus,   COVID-19 has high affinity to the lung, causing viral pneumonia.   Fortunately, most people get only mild respiratory symptoms. Those who have high risks (age over 65, chronic diseases) tend to get pneumonia and complications. The most important way to prevent the complications is not to get infection, practice common sense of prevention. If you catch the infection, start early treatment.

        "My son has a fever, I am concerned due to the coronavirus ?",
        "Covid-19 unlikely.   The usual infections in your area of Kwa Zulu Natal are more likely to be the cause of his fever. If he is exposed to someone who is sick with Covid-19, then you need to be concerned.   Meanwhile, treat him as you would have treated him 2 months ago.  If he has shortness of breath or any form of difficulty breathing, get him to a doctor ASAP  Would you like to video or text chat with me?"

        "Can coronavirus symptoms be mild for some people versus severe? For example, could it just involve being very fatigued, low grade fever for a few days and not the extreme symptoms? Or is it always a full blown cold and struggle to breathe?",

        "Good day,  I am 29 weeks pregnant and my profession is teaching, I also have a 2 year old son.  My chest and throat is sore, I have a constant headache and feel dizzy at times. Is it necessary to get myself tested for the coronavirus?",
        "Can give Dr. a call.   Throat pain can be from a strep throat infection (antibiotics needed), a cold or influenza (antibiotics usually not used), or from other causes such as allergies, irritants, or COVID-19.   Usually, a person sees the doctor (call first) if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn't go away quickly. COVID-19 tends to have cough, whereas strep usually lacks cough but has more throat pain  Would you like to video or text chat with me?"
