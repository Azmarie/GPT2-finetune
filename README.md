To play with this yourself, you will need to have `data-eng/` saved in your google drive, you can download them from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10OZ79IaD5XIleDt_BiPG193RPztjEJND?usp=sharing).

💡 In the notebook, we will prepare the covid dataset for fine-tuning, train and evaluate the model, and get the conversation going with test data or interactive chat input from users!
